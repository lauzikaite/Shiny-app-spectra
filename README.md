# Are you what you eat?

This is a Shiny app, facilitating an interactive urine NMR spectrum plotting, deployed by [shinyapps.io](https://elze.shinyapps.io/who_are_you/).

  - UI, SERVER and dashboard code is in ./ShinyApp-DietarySpectra/shiny_app/dsb5.R
  - NMR spectrum is generated using txt files, in which NMR spectrum intensities are different for one of the four compounds, representing different dietary biomarkers. In total, 64 different NMR spectra can be generated based on UI inputs.
