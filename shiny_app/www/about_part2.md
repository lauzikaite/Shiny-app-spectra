### Why do we study metabolites?

There are many reasons to investigate metabolites. Information about changes in metabolite levels provides an insight into cell biochemical processes and helps to understand, for example, how a particular disease is initiated. Knowledge of disease mechanism is essential in the development of novel drugs or treatment strategies, such as lifestyle changes.

Furthermore, metabolic profiling enables researchers to identify **prognostic biomarkers** - molecules, which levels indicate whether an individual is going to develop a particular condition, such as coronary heart disease, early before the symptoms appear. Early diagnosis can help fighting life-treating diseases and even prevent some of them.  

### How do we study metabolites?

Metabolites are studied through metabolic profiling techniques, which detect and quantity the levels of thousands of metabolites in a single biological sample.

One of the techniques is **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance** (NMR) spectroscopy. When a sample, such as urine or blood, is subjected to NMR spectroscopy analysis, a spectrum is generated. NMR spectrum of a biological sample comprises thousands of peaks, with each peak representing a different chemical group of a compound. Combinations of different chemical groups (i.e. peaks in the spectrum) allow to identify the exact chemical formula of a compound. Furthermore, the intensity of each peak is proportional to compound concentration and thus can be used as an indirect measurement of particular metabolite concentration.

Among all molecules detected and quantified by NMR spectroscopy are also compounds known as **dietary metabolites**. They are are specific molecules found in individual foods or beverages, which levels in urine are directly linked with our food intake. Analysis of these metabolites can identify the diet of an individual based on his/her urine sample alone very precisely. 

### Why dietary metabolites?

Associations between metabolites and various health conditions are found through large-scale biomedical studies, which involve hundreds and even thousands of individuals. Samples, usually blood or urine, are taken from each study participant, along with numerous physiological measurements, such as blood pressure, height & weight and dietary habits. Samples are then analysed using metabolic profiling techniques. The obtained levels of different metabolites are then compared between patient groups to investigate how different molecules interact in various biological processes. 

A lot of large-scale biomedical studies use self-reported lifestyle data, provided by each individual. For example, study participanyts may be asked to report an average number of hours of sleep, levels of physical activity, drug intake or to provide a detailed food intake diary. It has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19594967) that as much as ~30% of such self-reported data is incorrect. This represents a major limitation when looking for meaningful associations between health conditions and lifestyle/environmental factors.

Detection of dietary biomarkers helps to overcome this limitation as participants' diets can be accurately described using their urine NMR spectra, rather than self-reported data.
