**What is molecular phenotyping?**

--will be changed

Metabolic profiling provides the opportunity to identify biomarkers of exposure, early effect, early onset and disease progression, and to generate hypotheses about how physiological measurements routinely collected in epidemiological studies are mechanistically related to metabolic phenotype. e have used large-scale epidemiological sample sets to clearly demonstrate the metabolic phenotypic clustering by geographical location, and that variation within populations can be meaningfully related to physiological measurements (Holmes et al. 2008). This work has helped derive novel associations between urinary metabolites and blood pressure that has provided additional evidence for public health decision making and hypotheses to test relating to the underlying mechanisms of the observed relationships. Such approaches are also potentially useful in verifying epidemiological questionnaire data (i.e. does reported usage relate well to observed excretion profile) and for investigating the underlying causes of idiosyncratic drug efficacy and toxicity.

Such approaches are also potentially useful in verifying epidemiological questionnaire data (i.e. does reported usage relate well to observed excretion profile) and for investigating the underlying causes of idiosyncratic drug efficacy and toxicity. The analysis of these data have greatly been helped by the continued development and application of novel statistical correlation approaches that can facilitate rapid structure elucidation using spectroscopic profile data (Holmes et al. 2007). Furthermore, these resources present the opportunity to begin relating xenobiotic and endogenous metabolites in a way that can report on common biochemical mechanisms and highlight populations that may have a heightened risk of adverse consequences to exposure due to lifestyle or other factors.

**How does it work?**

By using modern high-throughput technologies, such as *Nuclear Magnetic Resonance* (NMR) spectroscopy, it is possible to detect the presence of various molecules in any sample, whether it is blood, tissue or urine.
